# VDT Creator

VDT Creator is a simple program for Indian students who might be studying java or any other language where they have to 
create VDTs aka Variable Description Tables. These may be asked for in projects or just plain assignments.Whatever it 
may be, VDTs are a pain to create. 

We first have to go and find all the variables we created and note their data types. After doing this we have to write descriptions 
for each variable and finally put all this in an excel sheet. All this tedious and time consuming work can be prevented by using this 
automatic VDT creator.
